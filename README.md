# fetch-live-cryptocurrency-data
 To fetch live cryptocurrency data, you can use public APIs like CoinGecko or Binance. CoinGecko's API provides an easy way to retrieve data for the top cryptocurrencies. By using the https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets endpoint, you can fetch details such as cryptocurrency name, symbol, current price, market capitalization, 24-hour trading volume, and percentage price change over the last 24 hours. You need to specify parameters like the currency (vs_currency=usd), sorting order (order=market_cap_desc), number of records per page (per_page=50), and page number. The response is returned in JSON format, which can be processed using Python's requests and pandas libraries to convert the data into a structured DataFrame for analysis. For example, the DataFrame can display fields like the top cryptocurrencies by market cap, their current prices, and their percentage price changes.
